In our training session we implemented the client-side of our 'group chat app' with angular js except the server comunication.
Sever was implemented to map client-side static files to root url using express js.

In our next Chamber of Xians Mean Stack session on next Monday at 10:30am (12-May-2014) we will continue to develop the rest of our app...
